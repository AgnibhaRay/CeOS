# CeOS
Finally its here‼‼‼. This is a custom ROM made from [`Android Open Source Project`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/)
# Overview😁
This a highly advanced operating system based on Android. This uses a technology called Mini-G to get all the google features without even google storing your data.
# Why Made This?🙄
This operating system mainly focuses on giving your fundamental right of privacy and also to give all of our users a smooth experience even with a low end chip. We use a specific 
technology to achieve both of our goals by creating an inhouse software named Mini-G. 
# What is Mini-G?🤔🤨
Mini-G is a highly advanced technology which lets you use Google services and simultaneously blocking the google tracking services from tracking your personal data. Mini-G is 
an Open Source Project whose code will be live on GitHub soon.
# Difference between regular Android and CeOS
The main differences are <br />
- All your data is safe with you. Your data isn't sold to the Ad Companies
- 15x faster than regular Android as it can run very smoothly even on a dual core chip.
